                <blockquote>"A member of the Masked Fools. Inscrutable and unscrupulous.
                    A dangerous maestro of theatrics, utterly engrossed in the art of performance. Adorned with
                    innumerable
                    masks, she is the hero with a thousand faces.
                    Wealth, status, power... None of those matters to Sparkle. The only thing that can get her attention
                    is
                    "amusement."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Sparkle wears a sleeveless and backless short red kimono with crossing black spaghetti straps. Cherry blossom flowers and a grey trim decorate the kimono along with a black obi belt overlaid with a small golden rope, which is tied into a bow. Attached to it is a white spherical ornament with a koi fish inside, with there being a golden tassel attached under it. On the back of her kimono is a large golden rope bow from the back, under which is a black large tied bow. She also wears detached short red sleeves with hanging fabric that reaches her knees, along with a cherry blossom flower ornament and a tassel hanging from it. Two light salmon colored fabrics hang from the back of her kimono, reaching her calves, resembling caudal tails. She has a black glove on her left hand, while her right hand is adorned with red ropes with a small bell attached to it. On her feet, she wears black sandals with thin red ankle straps, with small flowers embellishing each and a bell hanging off the straps of the left sandal. Additionally, red nail polish adorns her fingers and toes.

                        Hello, hello, I’m Hanabi! If you have any dangerous errands to run, just come to me. After all,
                        as long as I'm interested, the price is easily negotiable. The key is to have fun, right?

                        Hey, I keep seeing you lately... Where did I see you? Does this let you know, hehe~

                    <li>See you next time, unknown guest~ Be sure to pay attention to your safety, especially...

                        As for me, I just want to be a supporting role in the corner. I usually applaud the people on
                        the stage to enhance the atmosphere (the speed of my speech suddenly increases), and then
                        suddenly rush into the sky at the climax of the performance, bang! Explode it like fireworks -
                        (provocation) Does the protagonist dare to do this?

                    <li>
                        I don’t have much talent, and it’s hard for me to have persistent dreams... My latest dream
                        is... to join the genius club! Yes, play a genius! Ha, I really want to try this difficult
                        challenge... Does anyone support me?
